   - Recruiters can input or paste job descriptions directly into a text box.
   - The app identifies critical keywords and role-specific requirements from the description.

3. **AI Matching and Scoring**:
   - The app uses NLP algorithms to match resumes with job descriptions.
   - Each resume is scored based on how closely it aligns with the job requirements, including:
     - Matching keywords.
     - Relevant skills and certifications.
     - Years of experience.

5. **Dashboard and Insights**:
   - A recruiter-facing dashboard displays:
     - Ranked resumes with matching scores.
     - Breakdown of key metrics (skills match, experience match, etc.).
     - Graphical visualization of the candidate pool (e.g., skill heatmaps).
   - Filters for refining search by specific criteria like location, years of experience, or education.

6. **Resume Improvement Suggestions**:
   - For job seekers, the app suggests improvements such as:
     - Adding specific skills.
     - Tailoring experience descriptions.

#### **Technical Workflow**  

1. **Data Processing**:
   - Extract data from resumes using OCR (for scanned resumes) and document-parsing libraries like **PyPDF2**, **Docx**, or **Textract**.
   - Preprocess job descriptions using NLP techniques like tokenization and keyword extraction.

2. **NLP-Based Matching**:
   - Use pre-trained models like **spaCy** or **BERT** for:
     - Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify names, roles, and certifications.
     - Similarity scoring between job descriptions and resumes.
   - Calculate match scores using cosine similarity or word embeddings.

3. **Skill Extraction and Gap Analysis**:
   - Create a dictionary of industry-specific skills.
   - Compare the extracted skills from resumes with required skills in the job description.

4. **Dashboard Visualization**:
   - Build an interactive dashboard with **Streamlit**, showing:
     - Resume rankings.
     - Filterable tables and charts.
     - Visual analytics like bar charts and pie charts for candidate data.
